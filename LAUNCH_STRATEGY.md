# Launch Strategy: tracking.directory

## The Chicken-and-Egg Problem

**Challenge**: Companies won't post jobs/ads without users, but you need revenue to sustain the platform.

**Solution**: **Users first, monetization later.**

---

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. Content is Your Product
- Each tag is valuable content
- More tags = more SEO value = more organic traffic
- Quality content attracts users naturally

### 2. Network Effects
- More users = more contributions = more content
- More content = more users (virtuous cycle)
- Jobs/Ads work better with an established audience

### 3. Proof of Concept
- Show value before asking for money
- Build trust and credibility
- Companies will come when they see engagement

## Remember

> "Build something people want, then figure out how to monetize it."

Your platform's value is in the **content** (tags), not the features. Focus on:
1. Quality content
2. User experience
3. Community building
4. Listening to feedback

The rest (Jobs, Ads, Payments) will come naturally when you have users asking for them.
